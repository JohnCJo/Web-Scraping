# Web-Scraping

Perform basic web scraping using Requests and Beautiful Soup. For lightweight page
traversal, you might be able to get by with just Requests, which has overlapping
functionality with Beautiful Soup.
Optional: If you plan to build up a lasting scraping infrastructure for your project, then
Scrapy is worth considering.
